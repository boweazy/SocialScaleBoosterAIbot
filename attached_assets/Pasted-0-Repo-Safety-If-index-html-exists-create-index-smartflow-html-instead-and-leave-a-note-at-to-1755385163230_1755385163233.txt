0) Repo & Safety
	•	If index.html exists, create index-smartflow.html instead and leave a note at top: <!-- created by agent: safe build -->.
	•	Create new files only; do not delete or overwrite existing ones without explicit comments.

1) Tech + Files
	•	Plain HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks) + semantic, accessible markup.
	•	Files:
	•	index-smartflow.html
	•	styles.css (import in head)
	•	app.js
	•	/assets/ placeholders: logo.svg, hero-bg.jpg, avatar.jpg, favicon.png
	•	Performance: lazy-load images, compress where possible, preconnect to fonts.

2) Brand (Smart, Street-Smart, Futuristic)
	•	Colors:
	•	--bg:#0b0b0b; --brown:#1a120e;
	•	--gold:#d4af37; (use gradients for “shiny” effect)
	•	--text:#e9e9e9; --muted:#9a9a9a;
